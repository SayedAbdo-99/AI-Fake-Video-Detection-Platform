# AI-Fake-Video-Detection-Platform
<h3>Description:</h3> A project that works to identify fake videos using deep learning and sentiment analysis. Through, firstly generating a deep learning model capable of classifying fake and real videos using a convolution neural network (CNN) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, that achieved an accuracy of (97.6%). Secondly, generating a sentiment analysis model capable of detecting fake videos based on the comments and emotions, using Naive Bayes machine learning algorithms and natural language processing, that achieved an accuracy of (99%).
<h3>Target:</h3> Produce methods to detect the fake videos to solve many problems such as Criminal issues, fake news and validating the information in the videos.
<h3>Tools and Techniques:</h3> Python, Google Colab, Tensorflow, Deep learning (CNN and SGD Optimization), Machin learning (Naive Bayes, NLP, SVM and KNN), Sentiment Analysis, QT Designer GUI, YouTube Data API, Json, and Anaconda Navigator.
